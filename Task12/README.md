### There are two shell files for this task in addition to edited Dockerfile:

	1. First sh is install_and_add_user.sh
		This file was just used to keep track of commands for installing docker
		and adding myself as user
	
	2. Second file is build_and_run_commands.sh
		This file file for the task to build image and run container interactively
		as well as run bedtools.  FYI the path added for salmon was incorrect
		and need to be the salmon bin folder.
